# Statistics Project 2

In the last 20 years over 3000 exoplanets have been detected. This number of samples
is enough and the probability of detecting these as a function of different parameters,
such period, eccentricity, is sufficient. This data might give us some critical clues in
determining the mechanism of planet formation. I use data to determine the shape parameters of a beta distribution that is assumed to be the correct distribution of eccentricities for some interval of
orbital periods.
